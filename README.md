# Source code for my refrigerator

So, my refrigerator broke. It started freezing, I brought a new one (used), it did the exact same thing, I decided to repair instead of throwing away.

The refrigerator is build using an Arduino a temperature sensor, a relay, a LCD display and a couple of buttons.

## Thanks

I would like to give a special thank you to

* My uncle Jan Windelborg Simonsen for helping me with the arduino side and electronics assembly.
* My dad Michael Windelborg Simonsen for helping me control the pump in my refrigerator using a relay.

The project Testprogram is a test program made by Jan Windelborg Simonsen to test the hardware, it is not as such used to control the refrigerator.
